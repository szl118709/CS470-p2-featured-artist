issue: jazz.00054.wav does not open

---
jazz.00054.wav is about 100K smaller than all other files
jazz.00054.raw in Audacity (little end, mono, 16-bit signed, 22050) is playable but has frequent clicks

Using GTZAN_Fixed
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murataktan/gtzan-fixed
Jazz.00054-fixed-v1.wav
This appears to be a different file altogether

---
[WORKAROUND] 
Converted Jazz.00054-fixed-v1.wav to 22050 mono, like other dataset files
use this new file: Jazz.00054-fixed-v2.wav
